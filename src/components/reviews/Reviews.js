          review="What a pleasure to walk into our home and see an amazing transformation! Not only a fresh new colour but the brand new looking trim, smooth surfaces where there once were many holes and no mess to clean up. Nathan is a joy to work with and someone we trust. Thank you! It looks so good I donâ€™t want to hang anything back up!" />

          review="Nathan drove 40 minutes out of Edmonton to repaint several rooms in our house. He was on time, did a fantastic job, and cleaned up after himself. He also helped us solve some issues with holes in our walls and ceilings with simple and effective solutions. I would highly recommend calling Nathan and refer him to all of my friends." />
